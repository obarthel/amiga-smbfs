smbfs 1.19 (27.11.2000)

- Fixed ACTION_FINDOUTPUT implementation; the memory to hold the
  name of the file to be created was released before the file
  was created. This could cause garbage to be written to the
  output file.

- Fixed ACTION_COPY_DIR implementation; the name of the lock to
  be duplicated did not get duplicated.

- Fixed ACTION_EXAMINE_OBJECT and ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT
  implementations; protection bits are now reported 'properly'
  with respect to read/write access.


smbfs 1.20 (27.11.2000)

- ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT now filters out SMB names that include
  '/' or ':' characters.


smbfs 1.21 (28.11.2000)

- Modified ACTION_RENAME_DISK to remove the volume node before
  changing it. It also sends the appropriate diskremove/diskinserted
  input events now.

- Reorganized and rewrote the code to reduce dependencies on
  the compiler runtime library.

- Unified error reporting code.

- SMBFS can now be launched from Workbench using the same parameters
  you would use when starting it from Shell. Error reporting
  has been adapted to show an error requester and to pool error
  messages rather than printing them to the console.


smbfs 1.22 (30.11.2000)

- Fixed the test that looks for file/lock access mode collisions.

- No longer changes the case of the password; there is now an
  option to make the change.

- Fixed ACTION_SAME_LOCK which was comparing the same lock with
  itself.

- Added support for ACTION_EXAMINE_ALL, ACTION_EXAMINE_ALL_END
  and ACTION_WRITE_PROTECT packet types.

- No longer allows for files and locks to refer to "." and "..".
  The use of the backslash character '\' is also disallowed in
  Amiga file/directory names.


smbfs 1.23 (30.11.2000)

- In the ExNext()/ExAll() handling functions local error variables
  were shadowing each other. Fixed.

- The error reporting requester now also lists the name of the
  service to connect to. This should help in telling different
  invocations of the program apart.

- The size of the directory cache is now a configurable option.

- Added a new option which forces all name comparisons to be
  done in a case-sensitive fashion.

- Reading/writing data to/from a file in chunks larger than
  65535 bytes could fail and cause the file system to hang.


smbfs 1.24 (1.12.2000)

- Added an option to allow hidden files to be omitted from
  directory listings.

- Improved upon the error reporting in the code that directly
  calls the TCP/IP API functions.

- Reorganized the AmigaDOS packet handling switch..case
  list.

- Added support for ACTION_MORE_CACHE packet type. The
  cache in this context refers to the directory scanning
  cache.

- Improved upon the host lookup error reporting code.

- Added support for file name translation such as via the
  CrossDOS translation table files.


smbfs 1.25 (2.12.2000)

- SMBFS now displays some configuration information as soon as
  it has successfully connected to the file server and is ready
  for action. This output can be suppressed with the new
  "QUIET" command line parameter.

- When removing a directory, the error code returned is examined
  more closely to see whether the directory was not yet empty.

- When setting the protection bits of a file or directory, the
  file system now treats either 'protected from deletion' and
  'protected from writing' as indications to mark a file as
  write protected. Previously, a file had to be both protected
  from deletion and from writing to be treated as write protected.

- Cleaned up the program's data structures and eliminated all
  static data that would hold state information. The entire
  client side is now completely reentrant.


smbfs 1.26 (3.12.2000)

- File and directory names are no longer duplicated in the
  SMB abstraction layer. The strings supplied by the Amiga
  file system layer are referenced instead.

- Changed the way the ACTION_MORE_CACHE implementation returns
  its result code to be compatible with current practices.


smbfs 1.27 (4.12.2000)

- The changes I made to the file read command in order to allow it
  to read more than 65535 bytes at a time did not allow read
  attempts at the end of the file to come out properly. Fixed.

- Integrated password encryption code lifted from Samba. Hope
  it works as it should, because if it doesn't, I wouldn't know
  how to fix it...


smbfs 1.28 (4.12.2000)

- Oh dear, more fixes to the password encryption code and the
  connection setup to follow it. This time I managed to test the
  code briefly with Samba and password encryption enabled.
  Amazingly, it seems to work this time!


smbfs 1.29 (6.12.2000)

- Writes larger than 65535 bytes could stall and slow down the
  file system. Fixed. [Thore Böckelmann]

- The ACTION_MORE_CACHE implementation never returned the total
  number of cache entries allocated. Fixed. [Thore Böckelmann]

- Plain text passwords didn't seem to work any more after I made
  the changes to allow for encrypted passwords to be used. Fixed.


smbfs 1.30 (6.12.2000)

- Changed the structure of the share names by which the file system
  refers to the data on the server; they all start with a backslash
  now. This seems to help NT and doesn't break the rest.

- For file shares exported using 'share level security', no passwords
  will be transmitted.


smbfs 1.31 (7.12.2000)

- The ACTION_EXAMINE and ACTION_EXAMINE_FH implementations now verify
  that the name to return will fit into the FileInfoBlock's limited
  buffer space.

- Deleting files and directories from a directory currently being
  scanned via ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT or ACTION_EXAMINE_ALL will now cause
  the directory scanner to restart. This is ugly, I know, but at least
  it won't cause the scanning process to hickup or lose entries
  directory entries during its course of duty. The flip side is that
  the scanner will probably return some entries twice. There must
  be a better way to implement this, but for now, this is it.

- Tried to make device and volume node removal safer.

- SMBFS now always adds a device node to go along with the volume node.
  It's safer that way because for every file system you either have a
  single device node in the system (and no volume node) or a volume
  node *and* a device node. If the device node is missing, there's
  typically something wrong and some application software cannot handle
  this case properly. SMBFS will attempt to add a new, unique device
  node every time it is launched.

- When specifying the name of the file system device to add, SMBFS
  now complains if that name already exists.


smbfs 1.32 (8.12.2000)

- File and directory modification dates were always off by six hours and
  one second. I don't know how that happens, it doesn't seem to be a bug
  in the date conversion routines. I worked around the problem by adding
  and subtracting an adjustment value.


smbfs 1.33 (10.12.2000)

- The ACTION_PARENT_DIR implementation did not return a ZERO lock for
  the root directory. Fixed. [Rudolph Riedel]

- Replaced the doubly-linked Exec lists with skip lists which
  are better suited for the repeated lookup operations that
  are so common in the file system. This time the list code
  seems to work properly.

- Added -- largely untested -- time and date decoding routines for
  directory entries returned by NT.


smbfs 1.34 (10.12.2000)

- Had to take out the skip list code again since it did not seem to
  work reliably.

- Further tweaking to the NT date and time decoding code.


smbfs 1.35 (10.12.2000)

- Small modification to the ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT/ACTION_EXAMINE_ALL code
  which tries to work around a strange effect caused by Amiga Samba
  returning the contents of an empty drawer.


smbfs 1.36 (11.12.2000)

- More fixes to the NT date and time conversion code and the
  strange six hour fixup that seems to be necessary for the
  'regular' time conversion to work.


smbfs 1.37 (11.12.2000)

- Replaced the entire 'regular' date and time conversion code. The
  strange six hour fixup is no longer necessary.


smbfs 1.38 (11.12.2000)

- Ditched the packet size kludges in "sock.c" and "proc.c" I had put
  in there. It seems that only the 'smba_write()'/'smba_read()' code
  could trigger it, and that code was fixed quite a while ago.

- Migrated some code changes from the Samba source over to the
  directory scanner.

- Maximum transmission size per packet is now the same as the
  number the server allowed us to use rather than a fixed number
  imposed by VM page sizes.

- Tried to clean up more of the code.

- Discovered that the 'smb_valid_packet()' routine never could have
  worked and fixed it so that it now finally does what it should do.

- Better error propagation for some routines in "proc.c".

- More streamlined error testing code.


smbfs 1.39 (11.12.2000)

- Almost fixed several bugs in 'smb_proc_readdir_long()'.

- 'smb_proc_readdir_long()' does not work correctly. It only seems to
  work, but will fail if the scanner is to restart before the entire
  directory is read. Restored the old behaviour :(


smbfs 1.40 (13.12.2000)

- Took out some more unused and unnecessary code.

- Rewrote the time and date conversion routines.

- Modified the directory reading code so that it no longer relies
  upon the last directory entry index which doesn't seem to be
  correct most of the time.

- Directory scanning errors are now flagged as such.


smbfs 1.41 (16.12.2000)

- In the SMB abstraction layer, the directory cache is now invalidated
  only if the respective action that could have invalidated it succeeds.

- Now clears the directory cache only if the respective action would
  have affected the directory being cached.

- In debug mode [Ctrl]+F will display a list of open files and allocated
  locks.

- Added very silly support for ACTION_SET_COMMENT packet.

- Found an interesting bug fix for 'smb_proc_readdir_long()' in the
  Linux 2.4.0 kernel which seemed worth integrating into the file system.


smbfs 1.42 (19.12.2000)

- Integrated Chris Hertel's broadcast name query code. This means that
  the name of the host whose file shares you want to access need no
  longer be in the hosts database. However, you still cannot refer to
  a host solely by its IP address.


smbfs 1.43 (21.12.2000)

- The integrated broadcase name query code would conflict with the
  DNS lookup. Fixed. [Thore Böckelmann]

- The NetBIOS name query code now retries four times to get a response
  out of the network.

- Put the mysterious 6 hour time offset fix back in.


smbfs 1.44 (29.12.2000)

- Rewrote the host lookup error reporting code to use the appropriate
  API function.

- Discovered that all the functionality required by SMBFS was supported
  by the original free AmiTCP 3.0 release. Changed the "bsdsocket.library"
  open parameters.

- The ACTION_EXAMINE_OBJECT implementation consistently got the name of
  the root directory wrong. Fixed.


smbfs 1.45 (7.1.2001)

- Discovered why file and directory creation dates were wrong by about
  six hours. Fixed.

- The order of the parameters passed to the 'ExAll()' filter hook was
  wrong. Fixed [Thorsteinn Sveinsson and Matt Sealey].


smbfs 1.46 (1.2.2001)

- Removed the workarounds for the mysterious 'off by six hours' bug.
  The time delta value added was consistently wrong.


smbfs 1.47 (18.2.2001)

- The name of the domain/workgroup, the name of the user and the
  password to be used can now be preset using environment variables.

- Changed the command line argument template to work better with the
  newly introduced environment variable settings.


smbfs 1.48 (3.3.2001)

- Modified the command template so that the final parameter can no
  longer cause all other parameters to be swallowed. Also updated
  the documentation.


smbfs 1.49 (3.3.2001)

- Handling of ACTION_FINDUPDATE needed improving. It should have
  created a file that didn't already exist. It now does [David Gerber].


smbfs 1.50 (4.3.2001)

- ACTION_FINDUPDATE is now associated with a shared lock. It used
  to be an exclusive lock [David Gerber].

- The test to follow ACTION_FINDUPDATE that determines whether the
  file to open already exists now also tries to 'stat()' the file
  in question to find out whether it exists.


smbfs 1.51 (13.3.2001)

- Whoops. The new code to pull data from environment variables didn't
  actually check whether the work group name could be set up properly
  and thus didn't complain about it either. It now notifies you if
  no work group name was provided and none could be found.


smbfs 1.52 (22.6.2001)

- Added another option which allows you to preset the time zone offset
  to use when translating between the local time and the SMB server
  time. Using the default locale doesn't work for that purpose all the
  time since there are so many misconfigured servers out there.

- The ACTION_DIE packet didn't have the desired effect if the file
  system didn't have a reason to wait for any resources to be
  released again. It just wouldn't quit. Now it does.

- Before it exits, the file system no longer posts a disk change
  event if it was launched from Workbench. I found that the steps
  taken so far could end up deadlocking Workbench.


smbfs 1.53 (26.6.2001)

- Changed the file name parser; it should now be possible to tie assigns
  to files and directories on an smb volume. Since the updated file name
  translation code also is a bit smarter about when to use which
  file name separator character, accesses to the media should be a
  bit faster, too.

- When translating path names, trailing '/' characters are now properly
  parsed, i.e. Lock("/",...) should always bring up the parent directory
  [Matt Sealey].

- Duplicating a ZERO lock now works as expected.


smbfs 1.54 (27.6.2001)

- Directory and file creation didn't work that properly after applying
  the changes I made to the parser. Fixed [Matt Sealey].


smbfs 1.55 (3.3.2002)

- At least samba 2.2.2-12 on linux can send total_data of 0 bytes. This
  caused sock.c/smb_receive_trans2() malloc() (==AllocVecPooled) to fail
  on smba_readdir(). Fixed [Harry Sintonen].

- Added quickfix against crash if smb_abstraction.c/smb_smba_readdir()
  fails. This is by no means a real fix, but at least it doesn't crash
  [Harry Sintonen].

- There is definitely something fishy in the smbfs restart/retry scheme,
  it just doesn't work properly (all state data has to be, and is,
  reset when restarts occur, but still it tries to use the old data as if
  nothing happened). Someone should really take a closer look at this
  [Harry Sintonen].


smbfs 1.56 (3.9.2002)

- Rewrote the Setup() code which allocates and initializes the device and
  volume nodes. Lost all Forbid()..Permit() pairs on the way, making the
  code more robust and less weird.

- In proc.c/smb_proc_readdir_long() now specifically watches for the
  smb_trans2_request() function return empty data and parameter values.
  This is now treated as an attempt to read from an empty directory.
  Previously, there was a slight change that the information was
  taken seriously even if NULL was returned.


smbfs 1.57 (3.9.2002)

- Ran the code through GCC and rewrote the code to get rid of the compiler
  warnings that appeared to have something more serious about them. This
  includes, for example, comparisons between signed and unsigned values.


smbfs 1.58 (5.9.2002)

- Rebuilt using my own TCP/IP stack SDK. Rebuilding the code with the
  Miami SDK should still be possible, though.

- Changed the way smb_proc_readdir_long() aborts the job if no valid
  data is read.


smbfs 1.59 (10.9.2003)  [Harry Sintonen <sintonen -at- iki -dot- fi>]

- Fixed ACTION_DELETE_OBJECT to restart directory scanning, it
  searched for wrong object. Fixes the problem where every other
  file was skipped when deleting directory.


smbfs 1.60 (11.2.2004) [Peter Riede <Noster-Riede -at- T-Online -dot- de>]

- Fixed ACTION_SEEK, it doesn't works if followed by ACTION_WRITE.
  Fixes the problem by using the SMBlseek packet instead of just
  remembering the position in the local FileNode structure

- Fixed ACTION_SETFILESIZE, has returned an errorcode of 37 instead
  of 0L on success.

- Added support for the ACTION_LOCK_RECORD and ACTION_UNLOCK_RECORD
  packets.


smbfs 1.61 (27.4.2004)

- Reworked the ACTION_SEEK implementation. Turns out that the SMB
  lseek packet only seems to work for the Samba server but produces
  unpredictable results with Microsoft flavoured servers. The new
  code, which helps to avoid trouble with overlapping write access
  and seeks, now performs much like the old one except that it
  "notifies" the SMB server of the new file position to be used.
  Tested both with Samba and Windows XP: works as it should.


smbfs 1.62 (8.5.2004)

- Added sanity checks to the record locking code. For example,
  locking a record of length 0 must be considered illegal. Also,
  since the protocol deals with 32 bit signed integers for
  file position and record length, parameters that are "too large"
  and come out as negative values are now rejected.


smbfs 1.63 (9.5.2004)

- Added more sanity checks to the record locking code, this time
  to avoid integer overflows.

- Added support for the SMB 'archive' and 'system' file attributes,
  which are mapped to the Amiga 'archived' and 'pure' protection
  bits.

- Cleaned up the header files.


smbfs 1.64 (13.5.2004)

- ExamineFH() did not fill in the file protection bits. Fixed.

- Ported to AmigaOS4.


smbfs 1.65 (16.5.2004)

- The port numbers of the NetBIOS session and name services are no
  longer hard-coded. They are now looked up (netbios-ns/udp and
  netbios-ssn/tcp), and if that fails, the hard-coded default port
  numbers are used instead.

- Tried to reduce the risk of triggering buffer overflows by replacing
  calls to strcpy/strcat. This revealed weaknesses in a number of
  places, including the code that fills in the names of the directory
  entries.

- Instead of calling memcpy(), the code now invokes exec.library/CopyMem(),
  which should be a wee bit faster than what the 'C' runtime library can do.

- Merged with Peter Riede's changes: for small packets to be sent,
  SMBwrite is used instead of SMBwritebraw (which greatly enhances
  performance), the server max_xmit field is initialized differently
  if the session was opened with a SMBtconx packet and ACTION_SEEK
  no longer sets the error code to an undefined value in case of
  success.


smbfs 1.66 (10.6.2004)

- Added a paranoia check to the ExAll() implementation which should
  avoid trouble with extremely short data buffers.


smbfs 1.67 (27.5.2005)

- Replaced the long NT date conversion code with something hopefully
  much more robust. The results so far are both encouraging and
  irritating. Dates that previously came out as "unknown" are now
  processed, but there are differences between the dates shown in the
  directory listing and by listing the files by name. Go figure...

- Transplanted some more code from Samba to handle directory entry
  data conversion.


smbfs 1.68 (3.6.2005)

- It appears that Windows XP can produce directory listings with
  file/directory modification times set to 0, indicating that no
  such information is available, while the associated last file
  write access data is present. Previously, smbfs only reported
  the modification. If this data is unavailable and the date of
  the last write access is, the last write access will be
  reported instead.


smbfs 1.69 (13.6.2005)

- The time stamps used in "proc.c", as returned and submitted to
  the SMB file system on the other end of the wire are apparently
  all in Universally Coordinated Time already (or at least, this
  seems to be the case with Samba and Windows XP). Hence no conversion
  between local time and UTC is necessary, which would otherwise
  distort all date stamps converted. I modified the file system to
  leave all time stamps essentially unadjusted for local time in
  "proc.c". The local time zone adjustments are now performed only
  where the time in question is known to be Amiga-specific, such as
  the current system time or the date stamp to set for a file.

  The time conversion appears to be working correctly now, but it
  does ignore the effects of daylight savings time, which you might
  want to adjust for manually through the TIMEZONEOFFSET option
  (careful though: this overrides your current locale-defined time
  zone settings as far as smbfs is concerned).

  Unsolved problem: at least Windows XP seems to return different
  time stamps for directory listings and for indidivual files. As
  far as I can tell, the sets of time stamps returned for either
  doesn't match anywhere.


smbfs 1.70 (13.6.2005)

- Introduced a new option to account for daylight savings time
  when appropriate.

- Looks like some of the time stamps used in "proc.c" are
  transmitted in local time after all; brought back the
  conversion functions.


smbfs 1.71 (13.6.2005)

- The extended directory scanning entry conversion code now swaps
  the last modification and last write access date stamps. This
  matches the time of the last modification, as returned by the
  regular ACTION_EXAMINE_FH/ACTION_EXAMINE packets. Note that the
  time resolution is a little bit coarser because the modification
  time as expressed by the SMB getattr function cannot represent
  60 distinct seconds per minute but only 30. The net effect is
  that the resulting time stamps in a directory listing and by
  examining a file can differ by one second.

- The DST option's time offset was added to rather than subtracted
  from the local time. Fixed.


smbfs 1.72 (14.4.2009)

- In proc.c, smb_setup_header() initialized the SMB header length
  field with a number which was too large by four bytes. Consequently,
  what was later committed to the wire would have four trailing data
  bytes which could contain random values. This often didn't do much
  harm, but it seems that Samba 3.2.4 and Windows Vista don't like the
  looks of the trailing junk bytes.


smbfs 1.73 (17.4.2009)

- Modified smb_valid_packet() in proc.c to check whether the packet
  received is smaller than expected, not whether the length matches
  exactly. This seems to fix the protocol negotiation with Samba 3.2.5
  for now. Haven't checked Vista yet, though...


smbfs 1.74 (31.8.2009)

- Integrated Harry Sintonen's fix for the problem caused by large
  writes to files. The respective packet size was off by one byte.
  Thank you very much!


smbfs 1.75 (1.6.2011)

- The ACTION_INFO packet is now handled correctly if a ZERO lock
  is provided. Previously, it would return failure, prompting DOS
  to show its "please insert disk" requester.


smbfs 1.76 (10.12.2012)

- Added SMB over TCP support (port 445). smbfs now ignores the NetBIOS
  transport and uses the raw SMB transport. This seems to work both
  better with Windows 7 (and presumably Vista; it does work with Mac OS X
  Snow Leopard and beyond), and still works with Windows XP. Currently,
  this is enabled by default and still needs a command line switch to
  disable it.


smbfs 1.77 (21.2.2016)

- Added command line switch/tool type "NETBIOS" which disables the
  raw SMB transport mode, which is now the default.


smbfs 1.78 (21.2.2016)

- SMB packet decoding (and printing the results) can now be enabled
  with a command line option. The decoding functions, however, must
  be built into the program at compile time through the DUMP_SMB
  preprocessor definition.


smbfs 1.79 (21.2.2016)

- SMB packet decoding now includes the contents of the two
  packet buffers in the output, as well as the origin of the
  packet (which is relevant because the data has different
  meanings even if it shares the same command code).


smbfs 1.80 (28.2.2016)

This is the first release which incorporates changes from the MorphOS
smbfs version 50.3, which was kindly provided by Frank Mariak. The individual
changes came from Harry Sintonen, David Gerber and Frank Mariak. Thank
you very much!

- When converting the server's modification time for a FileInfoBlock->fib_Date
  we now prefer the creation time record if the modification time is not
  provided.

- When the file system enters its packet dispach loop, its Task priority
  is increased to 10 unless it already uses a higher priority level;
  the priority is restored when the dispatch loop terminates.

- The ACTION_READ_LINK packet is now properly rejected as being
  unsupported.

- The default maximum transmission buffer size has been increased by 4 bytes.

- Added another error message ("ERRnosuchshare").


smbfs 1.81 (6.3.2016)

- There used to be four different "max_xmit" variables which shared either
  the same name or were slightly different (e.g. "maxxmt"). It was hard
  to tell which was which, and which type (some were 'int', some were
  'word'). Turns out there were just two types which were relevant for
  the operation of the file system.

- The maximum transmission buffer size is now a parameter which can be
  preset through command line options or icon tool types. The file
  system now respects this upper limit and never sends packets
  larger than this number.

- Size of the packet buffer as allocated is now printed along with the
  SMB dump output.

- Reworked several word/dword decoding and encoding macros and functions
  which lacked proper casting from byte quantities to word/dword
  quantities.


smbfs 1.82 (6.3.2016)

- More rework in the word/dword decoding code and type casting.

- In smb_proc_reconnect() the server session key is now a
  local variable which is initialized as needed.


smbfs 1.83 (20.3.2016)

- Reworked the SMB decoding so that the ANDX commands can be
  handled properly. Not that I have actually seen any of these
  commands at work, mind you.


smbfs 1.84 (25.3.2016)

- Major rework of the code which decodes individual commands,
  their parameters and the responses. This is still incomplete,
  but it's a lot more useful now than before.


smbfs 1.85 (27.3.2016)

- Moved the SMB decoding code out of "sock.c" and into a
  separate set of files.

- The SMB decoding code should be functionally complete now,
  covering all the commands which smbfs uses.


smbfs 1.86 (27.3.2016)

- Figured why Action_Read->smba_read() could end up returning
  random junk in the first few bytes of the file being read and
  fixed it. All the work on the SMB message decoder has finally
  paid off :-)


smbfs 1.87 (28.3.2016)

- The SMB message decoder now converts date and time formats
  for display.

- The SMB message decoder now prints 64 bit numbers in
  decimal format, too.


smbfs 1.88 (28.3.2016)

- Added decoding of capabilities described in "Implementing CIFS"
  which are not described in "Common Internet File System (CIFS)
  Protocol".

- Integers documented as being signed are now treated as such,
  with the exception of the creation time field in directory
  listings.


smbfs 1.89 (29.3.2016)

- SMB message decoder now also prints NetBIOS session header
  information.

- Data transmitted by SMB_COM_WRITE and SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW as well
  as data received by SMB_COM_READ and SMB_COM_READ_RAW is now
  printed by the SMB message decoder.


smbfs 1.90 (29.3.2016)

- The respective fall-back code for smba_read() and smba_write()
  would fail to catch the raw read/write operation failing properly
  and end up skipping the non-raw read/write fallback operation
  altogether. Whether or not this happened would depend upon the
  number of bytes to be read/written, respectively. The net effect
  was that newly-created short files would remain entirely empty
  with no data written at all. A similar effect happened for
  the read operation.


smbfs 1.91 (30.3.2016)

- Turns out that the payload size transmitted in the NetBIOS
  session header was too short by 4 bytes due to a misinterpretation
  of the code and a subsequent "bug fix".

- SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW server responses may be followed not just
  by a single SMB_COM_WRITE_COMPLETE response, but might be
  followed by any number of SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW responses. This
  is now handled correctly.

- All functions in smb_abstraction.c now report and test for
  error return values in a uniform fashion. Mixing up return
  values and error codes is no longer so easy.


smbfs 1.92 (31.3.2016)

- Added NetBIOS header debug output.


smbfs 1.93 (31.3.2016)

- The DOS error status and code are now decoded properly.

- If there is no sufficient command data or other data in
  the SMB message, the decoder no longer attempts to
  decode it.

- Decoding of SMB_COM_SEARCH data had the client/server
  information mixed up.

- SMB_COM_READ_RAW now properly updates the offset value,
  and also sets the number of bytes read so far correctly
  if the initial read operation succeeds. Previously, the
  number of bytes read would remain 0.

- SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW now sets the offset value correctly,
  which in turn will update the directory cache file
  size information correctly, too.


smbfs 1.94 (1.4.2016)

- Added provisional conversion functions for UTF-8
  and ISO 8859-1.


smbfs 1.95 (2.4.2016)

- Plugged in the UTF-8 conversion functionality.


smbfs 1.96 (2.4.2016)

- SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE capabilities field is no longer a 16 bit
  unsigned integer, but a 32 bit unsigned integer, and it's
  called "capabilities" rather than "blkmode".

- The client capabilities sent to the server no longer have
  random data in the reserved and capapabilities fields.

- The client now identies as a Unix system if the server has
  identified itself as such, too.

- Fixed the 32 bit status field decoding. 32 bit status code
  ("NT status" codes) could have accidentally been enabled
  because the client capability field would contain random
  data.


smbfs 1.97 (2.4.2016)

- New oplock level in SMB_COM_LOCKING_ANDX could have been
  random.

- Last parameter word of SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW could have been
  uninitialized.


smbfs 1.98 (2.4.2016)

- SMB header is set to zero during every setup, and needs
  not be reset again.

- SMB_COM_TREE_CONNECT_ANDX no longer sets the error class
  before sending a client request.

- Changed mapping of ERRnoaccess (permission denied) from
  ERROR_OBJECT_IN_USE to ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND, which is
  closer to its purpose.


smbfs 1.99 (3.4.2016)

- Figured out that smbfs needs a minimum stack size of
  20000 bytes to run correctly. Modified the startup
  code to provide as much, if possible.


smbfs 1.100 (3.4.2016)

- smb_proc_reconnect() is now much more paranoid when
  it comes to verify that the negotiated protocol
  makes sense. It actually bails out if the server
  hasn't got a clue as to what protocol should be
  used instead of doing who knows what.

- If smb_proc_reconnect() negotiates LAN Manager 2.0
  protocol or worse, it now sets up the capabilities
  field to match what NT LAN Manager would have used.

- smb_proc_reconnect() now reads and uses the maximum
  raw read/write size from the server instead of just
  assuming that it will be 65535 (appropriate for
  LAN Manager 2.0 and older). Also, the challenge
  key (crypt key) length is read correctly instead of
  assuming that it will always be 8.


smbfs 1.101 (4.4.2016)

- Added documentation for SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_AND_X
  with regard to the LANMAN 2.0 protocol variant of
  the setup message in smb_proc_reconnect(). It really
  does contain 10 parameter words.


smbfs 1.102 (9.4.2016)

- Now builds properly for AmigaOS4.

- in proc.c smb_encode_smb_length() now properly fills
  in bit #17 of the message length instead of just
  checking for the message to be longer than 65535
  bytes.

- Added the few missing error messages for error codes
  covered by the "Common Internet File System (CIFS) Protocol"
  documentation.

- smba_write() now updates the cached file size if it
  manages to execute one successful write operation.


smbfs 1.103 (14.4.2016)

- Added DUMPSMBLEVEL option which controls how much raw
  data output is produced. By default (level 0) no raw
  data output is produced at all. Level 1 will print the
  contents of the command data area. Level 2 will print
  the raw data used by the respective commands, with any
  management/control information stripped off.


smbfs 1.104 (16.4.2016)

- For smb_request_write_raw() return values of 0 now indicate success.

- Simplified the raw read portion of smba_read() by removing the test
  that avoids dropping into a read loop below. The loop handles the
  special case well.

- Recalculated the overhead for SMB_COM_READ. It's still 52 bytes,
  but now the documentation states how this number comes about.

- Recalculated the overhead for SMB_COM_WRITE. It's 52 bytes and
  not 56 bytes.

- Recalculated the overhead for the SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW command, and
  it's 63 bytes, not 4.

- Unless smb_proc_write_raw() finds that sending the packet results
  in a transmission error, it will try to pick up the server responses.
  Previously, it would not even try that, which could deadlock the
  client<->server message exchange.


smbfs 1.105 (16.4.2016)

- Fixed decoding of maximum buffer size; this used to come out
  as 0, which made smbfs switch back to the default minimum
  supported (1024 bytes).

- Corrected use of the maximum raw write size as the size used
  by the client to perform raw reads with. The maximum allowed
  are 65535 bytes for a raw read request. Likewise, the
  maximum raw write size is 65535 bytes, too.


smbfs 1.106 (17.4.2016)

- More detailed error class/code translation information now
  shows up in the debug log.

- The SMB dump output can now be stored in a file, rather than
  having to be redirected to one. When storing it in a file,
  the output will be appended to an existing file, otherwise
  a new file will be created.

- The raw read/write functions now respect the upper limit
  for the amount of data to be written, as given by the server.


smbfs 1.107 (20.4.2016)

- Added WRITEBEHIND and PREFERWRITERAW options. WRITEBEHIND will
  allow SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW commands to complete asynchronously.
  PREFERWRITERAW will make the file system use SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW
  over SMB_COM_WRITE when it has a choice.


smbfs 1.108 (23.4.2016)

- Now properly handles the error code returned when Samba
  is asked to remove a non-empty directory. The error is
  translated to ENOTEMPTY.


smbfs 1.109 (23.4.2016)

- Activated the PREFERWRITERAW option which had not been wired
  up yet. Oops :-(  Turns out that with this option enabled
  write operations are indeed slower than the with the
  adaptive SMB_COM_WRITE/SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW code, on account that
  that SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW transmits the data in two packets, plus
  overhead for the server response.

- Recalculated the threshold below which a write operation will
  be performed using SMB_COM_WRITE instead of SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW.

- Fixed how the WRITEBEHIND option for the SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW
  command is implemented: the client must not wait for the
  server to acknowledge the command.

- Investigated the performance difference between SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW
  using the "write behind" and "write through" modes. In my tests
  the difference came down to about 10% performance gain for
  the "write behind" mode.

- Compared the performance of plain SMB_COM_WRITE (Windows 7) and
  the adaptive SMB_COM_WRITE/SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW (Samba 3.0.25).
  The adaptive SMB_COM_WRITE/SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW is about as fast
  as the plain SMB_COM_WRITE, with "Windows 7" running on the
  same machine as WinUAE (with AmigaOS 3.9) and Samba running
  on a local server connected via GBit Ethernet. This means that
  SMB_COM_WRITE is significantly slower with Windows 7.


smbfs 1.110 (1.5.2016)

- Added the DEBUGFILE/K option. Not everybody has Sashimi or
  a tool like it running in the background, which makes sharing
  file system level debug information difficult.


smbfs 1.111 (11.5.2016)

- You can now identify smbfs by checking the DosList->dol_misc.dol_volume.dol_DiskType
  field. It will read back as 0x534D4200, which is equivalent to the signature
  "SMB\0". This change was suggested by Chris Handley and Chris Young.
  Thank you very much!


smbfs 1.112 (26.9.2016)

- The negotiation in smb_proc_reconnect() picked up the server's
  maximum buffer size and then always added 4 bytes on top of it.
  From the looks of it, this was intended to account for the
  4 byte NetBIOS session header to be prepended to each SMB
  command block. In practice it could push the size of a
  write operation beyond what the server would accept.


smbfs 1.113 (29.9.2016)

- Removed the SMB_HEADER_LEN constant, since it wasn't actually referring to the
  length of the SMB header, but the NetBIOS session header plus the SMB header.
  This led to some confusion as to what exactly the packet byte offsets used by
  "proc.c" would reference.

- "proc.c" now lists the byte offset values into the packet buffer, so as
  to make it clearer what exactly is being referenced.

- smb_valid_packet() now correctly displays the expected and actual
  packet size.

- smb_setup_header() no longer includes the NetBIOS session header
  in the total message length calculation. Which means that smbfs
  no longer sends packets with a NetBIOS header which claims that
  the messages should be longer than they actually are.

- smb_proc_write_raw() no longer cares about the number of
  command words, but only about the number of data bytes and
  the command, when waiting for a raw write operation to
  conclude.


smbfs 1.114 (1.10.2016)

- The packet buffer size is now increased during the protocol
  negotiation, if the default buffer size proves to be too
  small. This avoids trouble with the MAXTRANSMIT option,
  which used to leave the original packet buffer size
  unchanged, and too short.

- The raw write operation no longer stumbles into a 0 length
  write, which the server would not expect and not respond to.

- Moved the test for the "write behind" option in the
  raw write operation so that it is handled before the
  server response (which hasn't arrived yet) is checked.

- Verified that the raw write operation can deal properly
  with the server response (interim update and write
  completion).


smbfs 1.115 (2.10.2016)

- The MAXTRANSMIT option controls how much data smbfs is
  prepared to receive. That value cannot be smaller than
  8000 bytes, and it cannot be larger than 65535. The
  code which sets up this parameter and verifies that it
  is in range is now implemented only once, and not
  twice in different places.

- The MAXTRANSMIT option also controls how much data
  smbfs may send to the server. This limit is no longer
  capped at 65535 bytes.

- The size of the message reception/transmission buffer
  can no longer be smaller than 8000 bytes and it cannot
  be smaller than the number of bytes which may be sent
  to the server.


smbfs 1.116 (3.10.2016)

- smb_receive_trans2() now verifies that the amount of
  data received is not larger than the maximum acceptable
  by the client. Previously, it compared the amount of
  data received against the server's upper limit. Ouch :-(

- smba_readdir() now stops immediately if no directory
  entries are supplied. Previously, it could deliver
  a bogus directory entry to the scanning function.

- The number of directory entries accepted by smb_proc_readdir_short()
  is now calculated according to how much data the client will
  accept, and not according to the server's limit.

- smb_proc_readdir_long() now reports how much data the
  client will accept, rather than how much the server will
  accept. This was problematic because that number is a
  16 bit value, and the server's maximum transmission
  value could be larger than 65535 bytes, causing directory
  scanning to fail because the truncated 16 bit value
  could be too tiny to report even a single result.


smbfs 1.117 (11.4.2018)

- Looks like the SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW implementation is really as simple
  as the documentation suggested. Just two packets need to be sent to
  to the server.


smbfs 1.118 (29.4.2018)

- Added const qualifier to pointers to immutable data, to identify
  further trouble spots.

- Replaced some instances of memcpy() with memmove(). For all others
  a debug version of memcpy() is being used which should log an error
  if the source/destination should overlap.

- When started as a shell command, error messages now go to
  stderr, if possible.

- Action_ExamineObject() could remove the leading '\' path separator
  from the internal representation of the object's path name, but
  fail to remember that it had truncated the name. This would result
  in Examine() returning a file/directory name with a trailing NUL
  character.

  The file system cannot access an object by that name, which means
  that it would report an error for an object which clearly exists.
  Fixing this bug might just resolve a number of inexplicable file
  access errors.


smbfs 1.119 (1.5.2018)

- Replaced the constant 4 with what it actually stands for,
  this being the size of the NetBIOS frame header (NETBIOS_HEADER_SIZE).

- The debug output no longer includes any plain text passwords.
  Note that weakly-encrypted password data may still show up,
  though.

- The size of the packet buffer used for transmission and
  reception of NetBIOS frames is now stored properly and does
  not include the extra 512 byte safety margin added to the
  end.

- How much data the SMB_COM_READ/SMB_COM_WRITE and SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW
  may receive and transmit is now decoded much more accurately, with
  the respective limitations (local transmit buffer size, server's
  reported size limits) taken into account.

- Renamed the various "maximum whatever size" variables used by the
  SMB_COM_READ/SMB_COM_READ_RAW and SMB_COM_WRITE/SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW
  commands to make it slightly clearer which respective command the
  limitations apply to.


smbfs 1.120 (1.5.2018)

- Both SMB_COM_WRITE and SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW commands would copy the
  data to be transmitted into the transmit buffer and then send
  the transmit buffer contents.

  It is not actually necessary to make this redundant copy because
  the contents of the NetBIOS frame header and the SMB commands do
  not depend upon knowledge of what's in the data to be sent. So
  we just send the header with send() and the data with another
  send() call. This might improve write performance somewhat.

  Note that the payload of the write operations will no longer
  show up as part of the SMB dump, as it is transmitted later.

  Similar code exists for SMB_COM_READ, but smbfs will always try
  to use SMB_COM_READ_RAW first, which does not return its data
  in a separate NetBIOS frame whose contents first have to be
  picked apart. No change should be necessary here.


smbfs 1.121 (4.5.2018)

- Replaced sendto() with send(), and recvfrom() with recv() where
  possible.

- When reading directory entries with ExNext(), entries with
  names longer than 107 characters will now be skipped. It worked
  like that for Examine() already, which flagged overly long
  names with the error code ERROR_INVALID_COMPONENT_NAME.

- Dropped the stub functions smb_request_ok_unlock() and
  smb_setu_header_exclusive() which were remnants of the
  original smbfs kernel code but served no practical
  purpose.

- Added additional buffer overflow checks.

- When reading and decoding directory entries, the buffer to
  hold the individual names is no longer grown by single
  bytes, but in steps of 16 characters, if needed.

- Simplified smb_request_write_raw().

- Removed unused local variables and function parameters.


smbfs 1.122 (5.5.2018)

- Rewrote smb_receive_trans2() for better readability, replacing
  the multiple pointer dereferentiations. Any error code returned
  is now converted from whatever seems most appropriate instead
  of passing EIO to the caller, expecting the caller to perform
  the conversion (which it doesn't).

- smb_release() now just closes the socket and does not
  allocate it again. smb_connect() reallocates the socket
  if necessary.

- smb_connect() now shows which server IPv4 address is being used.

- Added more debug output to sock.c, especially for all those
  cases which just returned error code EIO without stating what
  led to this point.

- proc.c no longer uses type 'word' function parameters and local
  variables unless these absolutely have to be unsigned 16 bit
  integers. This is what finally (!) made the SMB_COM_WRITE command
  work properly with 65535 bytes to be written. Because the final
  NetBIOS frame size came out as 65583 bytes (which the NetBIOS
  frame handles fine), and the size parameter being a 16 bit integer,
  the truncated size (47 bytes) wreaked havoc all over the place.


smbfs 1.123 (6.5.2018)

- smb_proc_readdir_long() could return an error code which would be
  mistaken as the number of directory entries available. The error
  code should have been negative. Fixed.

- Action_ExamineObject() failed to compare the correct file name
  length against the maximum permitted file name length. It retained
  the full path name length, which could lead to the operation being
  aborted. The same problem also existed in Action_ExamineFH().

- The buffer size check in the UTF-8 conversion code used by
  Action_ExamineObject() should have verified that the name in
  ISO 8859-1 form fits into the name buffer. Fixed.

- Time stamps used for cache validation are now unsigned integers
  rather than signed integers.


smbfs 1.124 (6.5.2018)

- recv() returning 0 is now consistently treated as it should
  be: end of stream.

- SMB_COM_READ now receives the inbound data straight into the
  file read buffer instead of into the packet buffer, from which
  it would then be copied into the file read buffer.


smbfs 1.125 (8.5.2018)

- smba_write() no longer decides on the fly whether or not it should
  use SMB_COM_WRITE or SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW. It's either one or the
  other now, and the same command is used throughout the entire write
  operation until it has failed or is finished.

- The write operation no longer stops if fewer data could be written
  than expected. This is documented and not an error.

- smba_read() now also sticks to either SMB_COM_READ or SMB_COM_READ_RAW.

- You can disable the use of SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW and SMB_COM_READ_RAW,
  respectively through the new DISABLEWRITERAW and DISABLEREADRAW
  options. These are intended for testing purposes only.


smbfs 1.126 (9.5.2018)

- Added the TIMEOUT option which can be used to set a send/receive
  timeout. The timeout is given as the number of seconds to wait for
  the reception/transmission to pick up again. If it fails to pick up
  an error condition will be flagged.

- Not all the calls to the recv() function took into account that
  the request to read the incoming data could be fulfilled only
  partly. The recv() calls have been replaced by a single function
  which makes sure that either all the requested data has been
  received, the connection has been closed or an error has
  occured. This bug is at least 20 years old, since it is present
  in the original "Sharity-Light" code which I ported in the
  year 2000.


smbfs 1.127 (10.5.2018)

- If the smb_receive_raw() function receives fewer data than
  expected it will always lead to the connection getting closed.
  Previously, missing data could lead to the session getting
  out of sync with what the server expected the client to
  process.


smbfs 1.128 (10.5.2018)

- Added support for built-in CP437 and CP850 "OEM character set"
  translation. CP850 appears to be the default character set
  encoding for file and directory names which Samba uses.

- The code page based translation now checks if the respective
  file or directory name can be translated and will ignore or
  reject it if necessary.


smbfs 1.129 (13.5.2018)

- The SMB protocol error information (error class and error code)
  is now retained in untranslated form for the AmigaDOS file system
  layer to report and maybe convert into a more suitable form.

- Error reporting ("something's wrong"), and specifically what is
  wrong are no longer the same thing throughout the file system
  code. This allows for the SMB protocol errors to be distinct
  from the POSIX error information, which previously was lumped
  together and made it harder to act upon. For example, a
  protocol error could be misinterpreted as a network error,
  causing the server connection to be dropped when this was
  not strictly necessary.

- SMB message decoding now produces its own specific error codes
  instead of using EIO. The errors which the directory entry
  decoding has to put up with are now specific to this function's
  purpose.


smbfs 1.130 (13.5.2018)

- Failure to set up an SMB session with the server is no
  longer reported twice.

- Failure to set up an SMB session with the server is no
  longer reported twice.

- SMB session setup error messages now display the SMB error
  information, if available.

- The debug output now prints the SMB error information along
  with the POSIX version and the AmigaDOS version. This might
  finally produce the kind of insights which so far have been
  denied to us during long data copying sessions which either
  stalled or stopped for no apparent reason.


smbfs 1.131 (14.5.2018)

- Hitting Ctrl+C (or using the Break shell command) no longer
  allows smbfs to shut down and then retry to open the connection
  to the server.

- smb_proc_read(), smb_proc_read_raw(), smb_proc_write(),
  smb_proc_write_raw(), smb_proc_create(), smb_proc_trunc(),
  smb_proc_getattrE(), smb_proc_setattrE() and smb_proc_dskattr()
  now try to reconnect to the server if the connection
  was broken by the previous network access.

- The reconnection attempt no longer overwrites the previously
  recorded error code if it fails to succeed.


smbfs 1.132 (19.5.2018)

- If raw SMB mode is not used, the NetBIOS session setup now works
  again.

- Reading directories which contain long names supports only the two
  documented entry formats now. All the other formats which might or
  might not have been supported by OS/2, etc. are gone now. This
  simplified the whole overly complex directory scanner code.

- Directory entries whose names are too long are now skipped while
  reading the directory, rather than getting truncated.

- Replaced the deprecated commands SMB_COM_CREATE, SMB_COM_OPEN,
  SMB_COM_QUERY_INFORMATION_DISK, SMB_COM_QUERY_INFORMATION,
  SMB_COM_CREATE_DIRECTORY and SMB_COM_SET_INFORMATION with their
  CIFS counterparts. The old commands are still in place, on the
  off chance that you just might want to connect smbfs to an OS/2
  or Windows 3 server.

- If possible, SMB_COM_WRITE_ANDX and SMB_COM_READ_ANDX will now
  be used in place of the older SMB_COM_WRITE/SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW
  and SMB_COM_READ/SMB_COM_READ_RAW commands. This makes both
  read/write operations much simpler than they used to be.

- Just to repeat the point here: smbfs no longer uses any SMB
  commands which the CIFS documentation describes as either
  "deprecated" or "obsolete" (unless the server which smbfs
  connected to does not support the LAN Manager 2.0 or
  NT LAN Manager protocols).

- Removed the use of the SMB_COM_SEEK command, which wasn't doing
  anything useful in the first place: none of the read/write commands
  actually required it (this is the one command which the CIFS
  documentation labeled as "obsolete").

- ACTION_SET_FILE_SIZE now actually works: you can make files both
  shorter or longer, as needed. Previously, you could not make
  files any shorter, only longer.

- Added the NATIVEOS option, which allows you to override the
  default of "AmigaOS", in case this should be necessary.

- smbfs now reports itself ("Native LAN Manager") as "smbfs" with
  the version number tacked on ("smbfs 1.132").

- Changed the translation of the POSIX error codes EPERM (operation
  not permitted) and EACCESS (permission denied) from
  "object not found" to "read protected". This is less misleading,
  but not much clearer either. Pity that we don't have an AmigaDOS
  error code which matches the blanket "you can't do that" error.
  Anyway, if it says "read protected" it now indicates a permission
  problem, rather than suggesting some file or directory does not
  exist.

- Changed the translation of the POSIX error codes EADDRNOTAVAIL,
  ENETDOWN, ENETUNREACH, ENETRESET, ECONNABORTED, ECONNRESET,
  EHOSTDOWN and EHOSTUNREACH from "object not found" to
  "directory not found". This is still a poor match for the
  purpose of the error flagged, but at least you'll get an idea
  that something isn't accessible on the network, rather than
  file or directory might be missing.

- Open(...,MODE_NEWFILE), which translates into ACTION_FINDOUTPUT,
  can finally truncate an existing file, or will create it if it
  does not exist. This uses the SMB_COM_NT_CREATE_ANDX command, if
  available (too bad for OS/2, etc.).

- Simplified the Seek() handling, because the formerly underlying
  SMB_COM_SEEK was basically only slightly worse than useless.

- Added another (so far) unaccounted error code (123) to the list of
  errors for which we have labels.

- Verified that the directory scanner built on top of the
  SMB_COM_TRANSACTION2+TRANS2_FIND_FIRST2/TRANS2_FIND_NEXT2
  commands actually does work. The SMB_COM_TRANSACTION2 message
  it set up was two bytes longer than it should have been,
  though.

- All file operations (reading, writing, setting the file size,
  obtaining the size of a file, reading directory entries) now
  support file sizes larger than 4 Gigabytes. In theory anyway,
  because the AmigaDOS API is currently restricted to just
  2 Gigabytes. Should the need arise, the 64 bit integer values
  could be made to do the job they were intended for. Note that
  file sizes > 4 Gigabytes are currently "clipped", which means
  that only the least significant 32 bits are used. There is
  is currently no weird workaround in place to avoid the side-effects
  of this policy.

- Updated the 64 bit integer math operations for the SetFileDate()
  function, which now has to deal with the SMB_COM_TRANSACTION2
  TRANS2_SET_FILE_INFORMATION command. TRANS2_SET_FILE_INFORMATION
  uses 64 bit date/time.

- Opening a file or directory, which is something akin to the
  AmigaDOS Lock() operation, now defaults to read access unless
  write access is required. The previous implementation always
  opened for read/write access, and if that didn't work, tried
  again with read access only. The read/write access is rarely
  needed, but is mandatory for file/directory delete operations.

- Manipulating file/directory attributes (which consists of
  flipping the "protection bits" for "read-only" and "was
  archived" as needed) is much simplified and no longer
  requires figuring out if the OS/2 or MS-DOS server at the
  other end of the connection can handle extended file
  attributes (unless you desperately want to, of course).

- Changing the attributes of a file/directory (as in: flip the
  "read-only" and "was archived" bits) is now distinct from
  changing the size of a file.


smbfs 1.133 (20.5.2018)

- The transmit buffer overflow check no longer warns about
  an overflow for the SMB_COM_READ_ANDX command.

- Reinstated the SMB_COM_CREATE_DIRECTORY command, since the
  TRANS2_CREATE_DIRECTORY command (recommended) does not appear
  to work with Samba 3.0.25.

- Creating a new file (through Open(..,MODE_NEWFILE)) will no longer
  end up creating a hidden file on the server. For good measure, I
  also added creation options to the effect that the object to be
  created must not be a directory, and that it is intended for
  random access.

- The "read only" attribute now maps to the Amiga "protected from
  deletion attribute" only. Previously, a "read only" file on the
  server would be reported as being both protected from writing
  and from deletion. On the Amiga side, protecting a file from
  deletion only changed the file on the server to "read only"
  if the protection from writing was in effect, too. Now we have
  a functionally identical mapping which hinges only on the
  delete protection.


smbfs 1.134 (20.5.2018)

- Ouch, so smb_trans2_request() no longer has to return any transaction
  parameter or data response information, but the code still updated the
  respective pointer and length information passed as pointers, even
  if these pointers were NULL...


smbfs 1.135 (21.5.2018)

- Creating a new file failed to close it after having just created it.
  Because file IDs are 16 bit integers, at some point the SMB server
  would have run out of IDs. It was reported to me that one SMB server
  may have refused to assign any further file IDs after 500 files were
  created.

- When creating a file using SMB_COM_CREATE, the read-only, archived and
  system attributes are no longer set. We just create a "normal" file.

- If the connection to the server is no longer reliable, it will
  actually get closed now, to be reopened later (maybe).

- Added a check to verify that prior to deleting a file or directory,
  all currently active file handles referring to the same file can
  be closed. This also goes for renaming files.

- Added a safety check to make sure that a file/directory which has
  already been opened is not opened again. Note that this should not
  strictly be necessary, but the current smbfs "architecture" identifies
  files and directories internally through their fully qualified
  path names rather than their file IDs.

- During session setup smbfs now properly reports that it supports
  raw read/write mode, large readx/writex mode, the TRANS2_FIND_FIRST2
  and TRANS2_FIND_NEXT2 commands and 64 bit file offsets (sort of).

- The length limits of the server and client names (16 characters) are
  now only enforced if NetBIOS session setup is used (which is disabled
  by default). The length of the workgroup/domain name is not checked
  any more (maximum length was 15 characters). Note that length limits
  may still exist which the server enforces and complains about.

- When creating new files the sharing permissions now include deletion,
  too, just in case you need to remove debris after smbfs had to be
  shut down, or your Amiga needed to be restarted.

- The "pure" file protection bit is no longer associated with the
  "system" attribute of a file or directory. This leaves only the
  "read-only" and "archived" attributes for manipulation.

- Connecting and reconnecting to the server now obeys the same timeout
  restrictions as the read and write operations. Should the server
  communication fail because of a timeout, reestablishing a connection
  to the server should no longer hang indefinitely.


smbfs 1.136 (22.5.2018)

- The network connection opened for the server now has the
  "keepalive" option enabled, just in case...

- Looks like reconnecting to the server after that connection
  broke down or was severed never actually worked for read, write,
  record locking and file attribute operations. Now it might
  just work...


smbfs 1.137 (24.5.2018)

- Updated the table of error codes which eventually get translated
  into AmigaDOS error codes. Quite a number of error codes were not
  properly covered.

- We now show how much memory smbfs has used (in debug mode), and
  how much memory has not been released yet.

- Trying to delete a file or directory now first checks if there is
  still a file handle or file lock attached to it. That test has
  been missing for the past 18 years...

- When trying to delete a file or directory, smbfs now asks the
  server for write access permission first. The server might want
  to object to this request before everything gets really serious.

- Added more debug output to show when a file/directory is being
  opened, and in which mode, and when it is closed. We also show
  how much of these file/directory references are currently in use.

- When performing SetDate(), SetProtect() and SetFileSize(), the
  respective file/directory is now opened in write access mode.

- SetProtect() now only permits you to change the "archived" and
  "delete protected" attributes. These are the only attributes which
  the SMB server really cares about on the file system level.

- Extended the "safety margin" for the SMB receive buffer to 1024
  bytes (used to be half that much, but Samba uses double).

- smbfs now only sends a NetBIOS broadcast name query for the server
  name that's part of the share if the server name is shorter than
  15 characters. If it's longer, the DNS lookup better work instead.

- If a file to be deleted has the "hidden" or "system" attributes set
  the SMB_COM_DELETE command is no longer ignored.

- Added further tests to figure out if a directory could not be deleted
  because it was not empty. However, it's difficult to tell all three
  cases apart which share the same error code. We'll try anyway...


smbfs 1.138 (25.5.2018)

- The name translation performed by the directory scanning code is now
  a bit more paranoid than before. They will check if the names can
  be translated into something suitable for use on the Amiga. This rules
  out control characters, for example. If a name is unsuitable, an
  explanation why it is unsuitable will be printed in the debug output.

- The SBM directory scanning code which uses the TRANSACT2_FINDFIRST2
  and TRANSACT2_FINDNEXT2 commands now uses the correct flag codes instead
  of naked numeric constants.

- Removed support for the "write raw" and "read raw" commands, which extends
  to the command line parameters and tool types which could be used to
  disable them or adjust how they would be used.


smbfs 1.139 (26.5.2018)

- Added more const qualifiers to pointers, so that unintended changes
  are more easily detected.

- Text that uses 8 bit characters now uses type TEXT rather than UBYTE,
  and TEXT * replaces STRPTR where it makes sense.

- Text buffer size and maximum size (without terminating NUL byte) of
  the string that may be stored in there are now distinct.

- Building the error message list for display in an error requester
  is now more efficient, as it no longer resorts to strcat().

- Removed the last traces of the SMB "system" file attribute and its
  mapping to the "pure" protection bit on the Amiga.

- File sizes returned (through the Examine(), ExNext() and ExAll()
  functions) now refer to the original SMB file size information
  which may be a 64 bit integer. Same goes for the file sizes
  referenced by Seek() and SetFileSize(). Note that for now the
  sizes returned will be truncated, which means that if they
  exceed what an unsigned 32 bit integer may represent, then
  the number 4294967295 will be used instead. There could be
  hilarious consequences: watch out!

- When scanning directory contents, names which end up containing
  unprintable names (not "#$@&%*!") after conversion to Amiga format
  are now ignored.

- Reading/writing files updates the internal seek position of the
  respective file, which is now a 64 bit integer. You can actually
  read from files > 4 Gigabytes (and write to them, too) as long
  as you do not use Seek(file, ..., OFFSET_BEGINNING) because that
  will box you into the first 4 Gigabytes of the file. Note that the
  result of Seek() and SetFileSize() will be a truncated position
  (4294967295) if the position happens to be beyond what can be
  represented by an unsigned 32 bit integer. Because "4294967295"
  is also known as the signed 32 bit integer "-1" you probably
  won't be able to tell it apart from a seek error (unless you
  check the IoErr() value, of course, but who does?). This
  used to be a problem with "normal" Amiga file systems, and now
  it's a problem again :-(

- When decoding directory entry data, we no longer replace the
  "last change" time with the "last write access" time, and then
  swap both time records again (who ordered that?). The
  "last change" time now stays the last change time, and this
  is what goes into the Amiga FileInfoBlock/ExAllData records.

- The debug output for the directory scanner now prints the original
  untranslated name in 'C' style escaped form, in case this might
  reveal further insights into why the directory entry names look
  like they do. Note that all file, directory and path names used
  by the SMB file system layer now appear only in escaped form, which
  means for example that all backslash characters which serve as
  path delimiters show up twice as much.


smbfs 1.140 (27.5.2018)

- When opening a file or directory for access, the access rights
  required now follow the original smbfs implementation which
  always required write access regardless of whether it was
  needed or not. If write access was not available it would
  retry using read-only access.

  The new code now starts with write access, even if only read
  access was required, and will retry with read-only access if
  needed. However, if write access was required, no retry with
  read-only access will be made.

- Only the directory cache needs to keep track of how much memory
  is available for storing file and directory names during directory
  scanning. Opening a file or directory doesn't have to bother,
  which is why smbfs can now do its job without allocating a
  minimum of 256 bytes per path name. This also simplified the
  path name management. Incidentally, the path name management
  could not reliably guarantee a NUL-terminated buffer :-(

- Finally figured out why files or directories created through smbfs
  could not be deleted again: smbfs could end up marking them as
  "ready-only". Fixed!

- Found and fixed a few utterly embarrassing "use after free" cases,
  which thankfully had little impact :-/

- The debug code now shows which file IDs the server assigned to
  opened files/directories.


smbfs 1.141 (28.5.2018)

- smbfs now makes sure to dispatch any "keep alive" NetBIOS messages
  which the server might send. This should avoid the problem of these
  messages piling up in the inbound traffic queue until all receive
  buffers have been consumed by them.

- When opening a file or directory the desired access modes are no
  longer "generic read" and "generic write", but very specific to the
  access mode. Write access now uses "read data", "write data" and
  "delete file", whereas read access uses "read data". On top of that
  "read attributes" and "write attributes" are also requested.


smbfs 1.142 (30.5.2018)

- Deleting entries from a directory no longer directly collides with
  directory scanning if the same process is reading the directory
  contents and deleting them one at a time. This means that the
  "delete foo all" command may work better than before (or maybe not).

- Constructing the parent directory path of the file/directory to be
  deleted now figures out how long the parent directory name is before
  copying it, rather than copying the full name of the file/directory
  in question and then truncating it. Also, the new code handles
  deletion from the root directory better.


smbfs 1.143 (30.5.2018)

- Renaming a file or directory can restart filling the directory
  scan cache if the file/directory was moved from its home directory to
  a different directory.


smbfs 1.144 (1.6.2018)

- When closing a file its modification time is no longer updated unless
  its contents had been modified. Simply accessing a file or directory
  without writing to it no longer has the effect of bumping its modification
  time.

- If reading from a file failed, the error code was not translated properly
  for AmigaDOS and always came out as ERROR_ACTION_NOT_KNOWN. Fixed.

- Dropped the NATIVEOS switch and the corresponding tool type.

- Added the UNICODE switch and the corresponding tool type. This switch
  will enable limited Unicode support for servers which cannot deliver
  proper directory information, such as the Samba 3.0.37 version which
  is part of the FRITZ!Box firmware. Note that once Unicode support is
  enabled, the UTF8, CP437, CP850 and TRANSLATE options will be ignored.


smbfs 1.145 (2.6.2018)

- I broke renaming by mixing up the length of the new name with the
  old name length. Fixed.

- Renaming now also works on hidden files and system files, just like
  deletion works on system files and hidden files, too. Keep in mind
  that a file or directory which is not write-enabled cannot be
  renamed (that's what the documentation says, anyway).

- Plugged the SMB_COM_READ_RAW/SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW code back into the
  file system. Added support for 64 bit file position information.


smbfs 1.146 (3.6.2018)

- Added extra sanity checks for file handles and file locks, which
  should prevent files from getting closed twice, or locks from
  getting freed twice. We also detect files and locks which smbfs
  does not know and reject these before it's too late.

- Dropped more unused code, e.g. in the cache invalidation function.

- Instead of using local string buffers, we now allocate memory for
  the buffers instead. This avoids truncating path/service names
  if these would have become too long for the original local string
  buffer to hold.

- Added the options PREFERWRITERAW, PREFERREADRAW and WRITEBEHIND.
  The first two will make smbfs use SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW over
  SMB_COM_WRITE_ANDX and SMB_COM_READ_RAW over SMB_COM_READ_ANDX,
  respectively. WRITEBEHIND activates somewhat asynchronous
  SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW operations, but don't get your hopes up just
  yet, as the effects are (so far) rather minor.

  Careful about the PREFERWRITERAW/PREFERREADRAW switches: if the
  server does not support these operations, smbfs will fall back
  onto the original SMB_COM_WRITE and SMB_COM_READ commands which
  cannot be used safely with files larger than 4 Gigabytes.

- Changed the command template: the debug options are now at the
  end of the list.

- The use of the DEBUGFILE option would pretty reliably trigger
  an Enforcer hit, followed by a system crash. Note to self:
  don't leave dangling BPTRs behind.

- If no modification time is provided for a directory entry,
  the creation time will be substituted for it.


smbfs 1.147 (5.6.2018)

- When processing the icon tool types, the values given for
  TZ/TIMEZONEOFFSET and DST/DSTOFFSET would override each other.
  Fixed.

- Path names which carry meaning within the AmigaDOS semantics (e.g.
  "dev:foo/bar//baz", which is the same as "dev:foo/baz") but do not
  necessarily have the same meaning or any meaning at all within SMB
  path names are now preprocessed so that they always come out as the
  proper absolute SMB path names required.


smbfs 1.148 (8.6.2018)

- Changed how the TZ/TIMEZONEOFFSET parameter works: for time zones
  east of GMT (such as CET) the number of minutes given now has to be
  positive (e.g. CET -> TZ=60). This follows the practice of describing
  a time zone relative to GMT, rather than how many minutes need to be
  added to current time to bring it to GMT. Hence, with TZ=60 you now
  state that your local time zone is 60 Minutes ahead of GMT.

- If the server shuts down the network connection smbfs should no
  longer wind up discovering that no more data would be forthcoming
  from the server, over and over again in a loop.

- When creating directories or files, smbfs now requests write access
  to the parent directory of the object to create.

- Consolidated all the SMB path name parsing and processing code into
  a set of functions which should (hopefully) be more robust than what
  was previously available. This simplified the code which needed to
  know the parent directory of a file/directory.

- Moved the file and path name conversion which deals with the
  translation from Amiga (ISO-8859-1) to SMB (UTF-8, CP437, CP850,
  etc.) into two functions (encoding and decoding) instead of replicating
  essentially the same code in almost all the packet handling functions
  which deal with names.

- Cleaned up the naming of functions and data structures a bit.


smbfs 1.149 (9.6.2018)

- Reworked the path name conversion code again. It now correctly
  handles "\foo\\" which becomes "\", and it will always remove
  a trailing "\" character from a path because unlike in AmigaDOS,
  the SMB path name only uses "\" characters in the path name as
  delimiters: at the end of a path a delimiter has no meaning.

- Tried to improve the contents of the error messages which smbfs
  will print when it cannot use the service and share name information,
  such as if the syntax has problems or the server name or network
  address cannot be looked up.


smbfs 1.150 (10.6.2018)

- File comments are no longer rejected, they are merely ignored just
  like any attempt to change the hold, pure, script, execute, read
  and write protection bits of files and drawers.

- The file creation/modification/access/write time information
  obtained when opening a file through SMB_COM_NT_CREATE_ANDX was
  "converted" to UTC, which is not correct. Only the older
  SMB_COM_OPEN command would provide local time information which
  had to be converted to UTC first. Same problem for the
  TRANSACT2_QFILEINFO command. Fixed.

- Just to see if it has a positive impact, SMB_COM_NT_CREATE_ANDX
  is now replaced by SMB_COM_CREATE for the purpose of creating
  new files. At least one Samba version crashed with the
  SMB_COM_NT_CREATE_ANDX command in use.

- If reading the keepalive packets sent by the server turns out to
  detect a broken server connection, we now shut it down on our
  side rather than waiting for a retry.


smbfs 1.151 (11.6.2018)

- The WORKGROUP parameter is no longer mandatory. If you omit it,
  then the default text "WORKGROUP" will be used.

- The UNICODE parameter now expects ON/OFF as arguments rather than
  being a simple enable switch. Note that the default is UNICODE=ON
  now, which means that if both server and client support Unicode,
  then smbfs will use it and ignore the TRANSLATE, CP437 and CP850
  parameters.

- Added the PROTOCOL parameter which can be either NT1 or CORE,
  with NT1 being the default. If you use PROTOCOL=CORE, then none
  of the new SMB commands (introduced in 1994) added to smbfs
  will be used, which might make smbfs work more robustly with
  certain servers.

- smbfs now only asks the SMB server for write access to a file
  or directory if that file is to be written to, or if the
  file/directory attributes are to be modified. I double-checked
  that these constraints are followed consistently.

- Reworked the logic for Open() with MODE_OLDFILE/MODE_NEWFILE
  and MODE_UPDATE. MODE_OLDFILE will open the file for read
  access and implies a shared lock. MODE_NEWFILE will open the
  file for read/write access and truncate it to 0 bytes, creating
  it if it does not yet exist, and implies an exclusive lock.
  MODE_UPDATE will open the file for read/write access and
  implies an exclusive lock.

- When opening a "file" smbfs now checks if the file is really
  a file and not a directory. The SMB_COM_NT_CREATE_ANDX and
  SMB_COM_OPEN commands can be told not to open a directory if
  a file is expected, but the current smbfs implementation makes
  it a wee bit too difficult to plug this into the API :-/
  Well, we may see about this later.


smbfs 1.152 (11.6.2018)

- Ouch. Forgot that pretty much all the core functions were
  still not supporting Unicode mode. Fixed.


smbfs 1.153 (14.6.2018)

- The modification time of files which were written to no longer
  get updated when those files are closed again. We now trust
  the server's file system to do its job.

- The SMB_COM_READ_RAW and SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW commands did not
  reopen the files they were handling after succeeding in
  reestablishing a connection to the server (following a
  timeout and whatnot). Fixed.

- If a command fails because of an error, we now only try to
  reestablish a server connection and repeat the command if
  the error reported is not an SMB protocol error. The protocol
  error may persist even when trying to repeat the command,
  but a network error may be resolved by closing the connection
  to the server and then reopening it.

- Removed the UTF-8 translation option, since it is not needed.
  The SMB protocol as implemented by smbfs only uses UTF-16
  (Unicode) or code page based path name encoding. UTF-8 support
  was added due to my mistaken assumption that what I now know is
  corrupted data sent by the server may have been UTF-8-encoded.


smbfs 1.154 (16.6.2018)

- The conversion of UTF-16 text to ISO Latin 1 and vice versa
  now stops as soon as the limits of the destination buffer
  have been reached. Previously, the code would still keep
  looking at what's in the source buffer.

- The log output now also includes information on how long the
  configured read/write/connect timeout is.

- The QUERY_PATH_INFO command now decodes the path name, if
  possible. This information is logged but not used for
  anything else yet.

- smb_proc_create() no longer closes the file just created.
  The function calling smb_proc_create() now takes care
  of that (which would be the smba_create() function).

- Added more debug output, covering the program options, directory
  entry decoding and other particularly exciting minutiea :-/

- The SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW did not properly fill in the 64 bit
  integer write offset, of which only half of the most significant
  32 bits were stored in the command buffer. On top of that, the
  maximum size calculated as being available for the payload to
  be sent to the server was too small by four bytes. Ouch :-(

- The test to verify that reopening the server connection has
  succeeded should have tested for a return value >= 0, instead
  of == 0. The problem is really with the API design of
  smb_request() and smb_request_ok() which either return the number
  of bytes received (for success) or -1 (for failure). So, the
  solution is to make both smb_request() and smb_request_ok()
  return 0 for success and -1 for failure.

- Added the RAISEPRIORITY option. Instead of always raising the task
  priority of the smbfs program to 10 while it is running, this is
  configurable feature now.

- You can now stop smbfs even while it's currently polling and
  processing incoming DOS packets. Between each call to GetMsg()
  it checks the break signal and will stop as soon as it can.


smbfs 1.155 (24.6.2018)

- Added a bit more debug output for the time/date conversion which
  is performed on directory entries.

- Directory scanning using the SMB_COM_SEARCH command did not
  remove padding characters from directory entry names. Fixed.

- The MS-DOS date/time conversion for directory entries returned
  by core protocol commands failed to account for local/utc
  conversion. Fixed. Now I'm curious if this actually manages to
  make things worse because the SMB server may have reported
  its "local time" as UTC :-/


smbfs 1.156 (24.6.2018)

- When processing the entries returned by directory scanning
  the names of entries would not be processed correctly if
  these were neither NUL-terminated nor NUL-padded. Thanks go
  to Tony Wyatt for reporting the problem.

- When preparing for reading from a file which was not yet
  ready to be accessed, accessing it could return an error
  code indicating that the access mode was not correct.
  Instead of retrying to access the file in read-only mode,
  the relevant function aborted the access attempt. This has
  been replaced by asking for read-only access and retrying.
  Thanks go to Tony Wyatt for reporting the problem.

- Slightly more robust handling of ExAll() due to the correct
  size of the the entry being known more early on.

- Printing the list of ExAll() entries to be returned crashed
  "reliably" if the number of entries was zero. Thanks go to
  Hubert Maier for reporting the problem.


smbfs 1.157 (26.6.2018)

- The ACTION_SETDATE implementation now shows the date/time
  to be used before it is handed over to the respective SMB
  commands which change it for a file/directory. Because the
  different SMB commands (three of them) cannot but change
  three times (creation, modification, access) we now make
  sure that all three are initialized by reusing the current
  state of affairs.


smbfs 1.158 (27.6.2018)

- Changing the attributes of a file/directory, as in "archived"
  or "deletable" did not work at all in protocol=core because
  the original code which handled this used the command
  SMB_COM_SET_INFORMATION2 in place of SMB_COM_SET_INFORMATION.
  The command SMB_COM_SET_INFORMATION2 can only change time
  information but not the attributes. I changed this to use
  SMB_COM_SET_INFORMATION when necessary.

- Changing the attributes and/or times of files/directories
  would have no effect if the server dropped out, the connection
  had to be reestablished and the file/directory in question had
  to be reopened because all the attribute and file information
  was overwritten. Fixed.


smbfs 1.159 (29.6.2018)

- Examine() did not use the creation time provided by the SMB
  server in place of the modification time in case the modification
  time was not currently set. Fixed.

- Simplified the handling of the file/directory protection flags.
  Because only two flags are actually reported by the SMB protocol
  and may be changed, only these two now receive attention. smbfs
  still makes up the rest (hold/script/pure/read/write/execute), but
  the respective group/other read/write/execute/delete flags are
  no longer filled in.


smbfs 1.160 (30.6.2018)

- The default for the "protocol" option is now "core" rather than
  "nt1" because it appears to be generally the most compatible
  choice.

- Delete(), CreateDir(), Lock(), SetProtect(), Rename(), Open(), SetDate()
  and SetComment() now ignore any part of the path name passed in which
  includes the name of an assignment, volume or device name (e.g.
  "smbfs0:directory/file") and only pay attention to the part which
  follows it (e.g. for "smbfs0:directory/file" only "directory/file"
  is considered relevant). This is necessary for assignments and also
  soft links to work. Thanks go to Thomas Rapp for reporting the problem.

- The SMB commands underlying the Delete() and Rename() operations support
  MS-DOS wildcards for selecting the directory entries affected. This is
  a major problem because there is no "escape" from the wildcard scheme.
  Hence, attempting to delete a file called "*" will delete everything
  in the same directory as the file "*". For now I have blocked the
  use of the "*" and "?" characters in file/directory names for Delete(),
  Rename(), Open(...,MODE_NEWFILE) and CreateDir(). It's possible that
  the same restrictions will have to be applied to the '>', '"' and
  '<' characters which are the Windows NT variants of the MS-DOS
  '?', '.' and '*' characters used in wildcards.

- The SMB_COM_RENAME command needed an extra alignment byte preceding
  the destination name if Unicode support was enabled. Because the destination
  name was misaligned, the individual characters were decoded incorrectly
  by the SMB server. This is what caused the "renamed" directories to wind
  up in the share's top level directory bearing names composed of Chinese,
  Japanese and Korean ideographs, none of which were printable on the Amiga.
  This caused the rename directory entries to disappear from view. Thanks go
  to Thomas Rapp for finding the problem.

- Removed the unused and non-working code for TRANS2_CREATE_DIRECTORY. What
  remains is the working SMB_COM_CREATE_DIRECTORY support.

- Cleaned up the SMB_COM_SET_INFORMATION command setup, which did not
  zero out the reserved data and added an unnecessary empty string.


smbfs 1.161 (6.7.2018)

- Simplified the directory entry processing for ExAll().

- The ExAll() entry processing did not handle buffer overflows safely.
  It failed to detect the case of the first entry to be added to the
  ExAllData buffer being too large, which should have always resulted
  in the directory scanning process to be aborted.

- All ExAllData buffer entries now have a NULL pointer in the
  ed_Comment field instead of a pointer to an empty string. This
  matches the documented behaviour of the Amiga ROM file system.

- The ExAll() code now stops reading further directory entries from
  the server either when it has completely filled the ExAllData buffer
  or when an error has occured.

- ExAll() now ends with result == DOSFALSE and error == ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES
  only if no directory entry could be read and the server has
  stated that no more entries will be forthcoming.

- ExAll() now assumes that entries of type ED_NAME need to be returned
  as the minimum requirement. Any values outside the range of
  ED_NAME..ED_OWNER will be treated like ED_OWNER.


smbfs 1.162 (7.7.2018)

- Added extra sanity checking for the Examine/ExamineFH code to make sure
  that the length of the directory or file name in question, which might
  be the name of the volume itself, does not overrun the FileInfoBlock
  name buffer.

- The FHFromLock code did not verify if the FileLock in question actually
  did refer to a file. Fixed.

- The RenameDisk code did not check if the new volume was sound and
  suitable for a volume. Fixed.

- Added a "bug compatibility" fix for ChangeMode to the effect that
  if the new mode is one of MODE_OLDFILE or MODE_READWRITE then the
  mode will be converted to SHARED_LOCK, and if it is MODE_NEWFILE
  then it will be converted to EXCLUSIVE_LOCK.

- Added an example program of how to use ExAll(), for testing the
  smbfs implementation of this function.


smbfs 1.163 (15.7.2018)

- The service may now include a port number or TCP service name,
  e.g //server-name:445/share-name would use port 445 when connecting
  to the server named "server-name" rather than using the default
  port number (which depends upon the use of the "netbios" option).

- Added the MAXNAMELEN option which can be used to omit files
  and drawers while drawer contents are searched and returned to
  the Amiga. Names longer than what the MAXAMELEN option
  states will be ignored. The MAXAMELEN option default is
  not to omit any file and drawer names.


smbfs 1.164 (17.7.2018)

- The result of a successful gethostbyname() lookup does not contain
  a list of IP addresses and protocol information which can be used
  straight away. It must be copied to a 'struct sockaddr_in' before
  it can be used with the connect() function, for example. This led
  to problems on 68000 machines because the contents of the data
  structure referenced are not guaranteed to be 16-bit word aligned,
  for example. Thanks go to Timm Mueller for finding the problem!


smbfs 1.165 (19.7.2018)

- The device, volume or assignment part of a fully qualified
  path name must be removed, including the ":" character which
  terminates it. Previously, the device/volume/assignment name
  was removed, but a second step further down the line took
  care of the ":" character. The new approach is more consistent.

- Replaced the processing function whose purpose is to combine an
  existing SMB path name with a translated form of an AmigaDOS
  path name. The new code works very much like an actual local
  disk based file system would in handling the ":" and "/" path
  separators. Previously, the SMB path and the AmigaDOS path were
  combined and then processed, which could have the effect of
  quietly swallowing the effects of invalid path specifications.
  The new code is able to detect these and will report them.

- The handling of ACTION_PARENT with lock = root directory is now
  different from what happens if ACTION_LOCATE_OBJECT is used with
  name = "/" and the lock = root directory. ACTION_PARENT with
  lock = root directory are valid parameters and will return the
  "ZERO lock". ACTION_LOCATE_OBJECT with name = "/" and lock = root
  directory is not a valid combination and must return failure
  with error code = ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND. Without this distinction
  software may be unable to successfully navigate the file system
  tree and get stuck in a loop. The new path processing code
  allows both cases to be different, whereas previously the results
  could be identical.


smbfs 1.166 (20.7.2018)

- Added the DISABLEEXALL switch which can be used to completely
  disable support for the dos.library/ExAll() function within
  smbfs.

  Disabling the ExAll() function is recommend if you intend to use
  software with smbfs which reserves too little memory for the buffer
  which smbfs is to fill when processing the directory contents it
  is reading.

  If there is not enough memory provided, smbfs may eventually stop
  providing further directory entries, flagging an error. This can
  give the appearance of smbfs losing directory entries during the
  scanning process when in fact it stopped because was unable to
  store the directory entry names in the buffer supplied by the
  application which invoked it.

  Stopping because it cannot continue may not necessarily be handled
  well by the application, which may just treat it no different from
  the any indication that smbfs has no further entries to provide
  because the SMB server has already transmitted the last entry.

- When running out of space trying store another directory entry, the
  smbfs ExAll() function could fail to allow for scanning to resume.
  This would cause smbfs to lose directory entries.

- Updated the "exall-example" program to allow easier testing with
  small buffer sizes. The default buffer size used to be 4096 bytes
  which failed to reproduce most of the smbfs ExAll implementation
  problems :-(


smbfs 1.167 (20.7.2018)

- Added real support for ExAllEnd(). Previously, the implementation
  was only pretending that it was stopping directory scanning.

- Rewrote the ExAll() code again to be clearer with regard to how the
  data structures are initialized and what its return code means.

  It now always returns DOSFALSE after the last directory entry
  has been delivered, since the ExAll() implementation is to mirror
  what ExAll() would do in the same situation: return FALSE only if
  it is certain that no more entries can be delivered.


smbfs 1.168 (21.7.2018)

- Added more detailed information about the sender of a packet, which
  can now be traced to the CLI number and the name of the command
  involved, if any.

- Open(..,MODE_READWRITE) now attempts to create a file if it does
  not yet exist, otherwise it opens it for write access. This hasn't
  worked properly yet. Thanks go to Hubert Maier who provided a
  test case.


smbfs 1.169 (22.7.2018)

- Open(..,MODE_READWRITE) implies a shared lock.

- The test for MS-DOS characters in the names of files to be created
  is now delayed for Open(..,MODE_READWRITE) until it is certain that
  a file needs to be created.

- When creating a new file for Open(..,MODE_NEWFILE) or for
  Open(..,MODE_READWRITE), the process is no longer aborted if
  the creation fails. Failure may just be the result of a different
  SMB client succeeding in creating it first. smbfs now tries to
  create the file and the later attempts to open it. Failure to open
  the file is then reported as an error.


smbfs 1.170 (22.7.2018)

- Path name processing failed to deal properly with subdirectories of
  directories which were located in the root directory. Thanks go
  to Hubert Maier who reported the problem.


smbfs 1.171 (24.7.2018)

- Calling Info((BPTR)NULL, parameterBlock) would trash memory. Fixed.

- Replaced all the various checks for valid locks and files with
  common code.


smbfs 1.172 (26.7.2018)

- SetFileSize() never checked if the volume was write-protected. Ouch.

- ExAll() now checks if the type of records it should return is valid,
  which in this case means if it is > 0. Previously, it treated 0
  just like it would treat values > ED_OWNER. Now it rejects 0 with
  the error code ERROR_BAD_NUMBER.


smbfs 1.173 (5.8.2018)

- Turns out that there is a counterpart to the broadcast name query
  which Christopher R. Hertel provided me with. It is possible to ask
  an SMB server about its own name if you send it a NetBIOS status
  query, and if it responds to the query. Normally, you'd ask the
  primary domain controller, which maintains the browse list of all
  SMB servers in the neighbourhood, but this can work, too.

  Anyway, you no longer need to add a local DNS record which associates
  the IPv4 address of a SMB server with the name of that server.


smbfs 1.174 (8.8.2018)

- "SHARE" is now an alias for "SERVICE".

- I no workgroup name is provided, smbfs will now first try to ask the
  server about its workgroup name before eventually falling back onto
  the default name "WORKGROUP".

- Removed the "PREFERREADRAW" and "PREFERWRITERAW" switches since they
  lack a purpose, now that "PROTOCOL=core" has been the default operating
  mode for smbfs for quite a while...


smbfs 1.175 (9.8.2018)

- The command line template would still include the PREFERREADRAW/S
  and PREFERWRITERAW/S entries. Fixed.

- The debug options and the debug file are now taken care of as early
  as possible, so as to allow for the icon tool type/shell parameter
  processing to be logged.

- Simplified the process of opening/creating the debug output file.

- Which environment variables are used when the WORKGROUP,
  USERNAME, PASSWORD, DEVICENAME and PROTOCOL arguments are
  omitted now shows up in the debug output.

- All the parameter which control how smbfs works are now shown in
  the debug output. The password text is omitted, though, but there
  is a placeholder which indicates whether a password was used, or
  whether it was omitted.

- Added more debug output to the SendNetBIOSStatusQuery() function.

- Updated the documentation.


smbfs 1.176 (12.8.2018)

- The smb_proc_reconnect() function did not handle SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX
  correctly if Unicode support was enabled both by the server and smbfs.

  The plain text password should have been transmitted in UTF16LE form,
  as well as the user name, the workgroup name, the native OS and the
  native LAN manager information.

  Strangely, with these corrections the session setup no longer works
  with Windows 7, but it works well with Samba.

  So, what do we do? It appears that you can delay throwing the
  "the client uses Unicode strings" switch until after the session
  has been properly established. We now have a new option to control
  how this is done. SESSIONSETUP=DELAY (the default) delays the
  switch to Unicode and SESSIONSETUP=NODELAY switches to Unicode
  at the earliest possible time.

- The CASESENSITIVE option now correctly clears the "path names are
  not case sensitive" flag of the SMB messages which smbfs sends to
  the server.

- The default workgroup name of "WORKGROUP" could still be used even if
  the server had been queried to provide its current workgroup name. Fixed.


smbfs 1.177 (27.8.2018)

- Implemented ACTION_CURRENT_VOLUME correctly.

- Updated the documentation again.

- Replacement stack should not be allocated as public memory. Fixed.

- Clarified how Action_Parent(), Action_FreeLock() and
  Action_ChangeMode() are supposed to work.

- Action_CopyDir() now tests for an invalid lock much earlier,
  which avoids testing the access mode first and then acting
  upon it.

- Action_SameLock() now uses case-sensitive path name comparison
  if smbfs is required to. Previously, it would always use
  case-insensitive comparison.

- Unified and simplified commonly-used code.

- Added more debug output in order to find that pesky AsyncWB
  batch rename problem :-/


smbfs 1.178 (29.8.2018)

- Unified and simplified even more commonly-used code.

- Debug output now includes how many packets are currently waiting
  to be processed and how much time it took to process each
  single packet.

- Modified the string formatting code to respect buffer size limitations.


smbfs 1.179 (2.9.2018)

- Cleaned up the debug code, removing unnecessary line feed characters
  and fixing the broken protection flag output.


smbfs 1.180 (15.9.2018)

- The ACTION_INHIBIT packet is now rejected as "not known" since this
  file system cannot actually support it properly.

- If you provided the file system with a volume name, then you can
  disable/enable the file system (as if the medium had been removed from
  a CD-ROM or floppy disk drive) with the [Ctrl]+D (= disable)
  and [Ctrl]+E (= enable) keys.


smbfs 1.181 (15.9.2018)

- ACTION_FREE_LOCK now correctly returns an error if the file lock in
  question cannot be freed. For example, this may happen if the
  file system is currently disabled.

- Updated the documentation.


smbfs 1.182 (19.9.2018)

- Added the SETENV switch which should make it easier to stop, disable
  and re-enable smbfs through shell scripts. Please note that this
  feature only works if you start smbfs as a shell program.


smbfs 1.183 (13.10.2018)

- Simplified the path name resolution code yet again, making it more
  robust and integrating support for corner cases such as an unnecessary
  "/" at the end of a path name. Verified that this actually produces the
  results I expected.

- All packet handling functions now set the secondary packet result
  code to 0 if they succeed. This should not be necessary, but some
  software unfortunately consults the secondary result to find out
  if the file system operation was entirely successful rather than
  first checking the primary result.

- ACTION_INFO failed to properly indicate failure and also failed
  to return a proper error code. Fixed.

- Added support for the ACTION_FILESYSTEM_ATTR packet type.


smbfs 1.184 (3.11.2018)

- The maximum file name length reported by ACTION_FILESYSTEM_ATTR returned
  the file name length limit, not the actual maximum length. Fixed.

- If raw SMB transport is disabled and the NetBIOS session setup procedure
  is used, the packet sent now has the correct length. Thanks go to
  Robert Kidd who found the problem and provided a patch.

- smbfs used to convert the user name provided to all-upper case characters.
  As Robert Kidd could demonstrate, this is not a requirement for all
  SMBv1/CIFS servers. The server can even deny access if the user
  name does not match exactly, which is what the Solaris/OpenSolaris/OpenIndiana
  SMB server dos. smbfs can now be told not to change the user name through the
  CHANGEUSERNAMECASE=NO option. If omitted, this option defaults to
  CHANGEUSERNAMECASE=YES, which used to be the default for all previous
  smbfs versions.

- For consistency the new CHANGEPASSWORDCASE option replaces and overrides
  the old CHANGECASE option. If you omit the CHANGEPASSWORDCASE option,
  the CHANGECASE option value will be used instead, which defaults to NO.
